# Aircraft Pitch Control
This project focuses on the dynamic modeling and control of aircraft pitch motion, highlighting state
space analysis and control design techniques. The aircraft's pitch dynamics are modeled considering 
forces and moments, including tail lift, aerodynamic effects, and damping. A third-order system 
representation is developed using Laplace transforms to capture the core dynamics, integrating 
actuator and aerodynamic damping effects. 
State-space equations are derived, with the system's controllability and observability validated 
through rank analysis of the respective matrices. Minimal realization and dual system properties are 
explored, and stability is confirmed using eigenvalue analysis, ensuring internal and BIBO stability. 
Controllers, including PID and LQR, are designed to meet specified performance criteria, such as 
minimal overshoot and fast settling times. Observer-based compensators are developed to estimate 
and converge on system states. 
Through comparative analysis of open-loop, PID, and LQR control responses, the study emphasizes the 
advantages of modern control strategies in achieving optimal pitch control. Phase portraits and 
stability analyses provide further insights into system behavior. This comprehensive approach 
combines theoretical modeling with practical controller design, demonstrating robust aircraft pitch 
control.
